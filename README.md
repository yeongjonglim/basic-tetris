# Tetris Game based on Vanilla Javascript

A very simple Tetris Game with no external Javascript libraries.

## Getting Started

Simply download the files and open index.html to get started!

## Issues and To-dos

1. Improper CSS and require further improvements.
2. To fix the rotation bug. Tetromino will cross the edge when rotating at the edge.
3. To add support for drawing of tetromino line by line when dropping from top of the edge, starting from the lowest cell of the tetromino.
4. To add support for sliding when tetromino hits to the bottom.
5. To add support for difficulty level.
